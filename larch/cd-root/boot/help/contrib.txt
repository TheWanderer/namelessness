HOWTO: Contribute to these help files

This help is rather simplistic.
In order to provide help files or translations you simply need to make a text
file.  Formatting is important (due to grub limitations).  The files MUST be 80
characters wide, and 23 lines long.  Any more, and your formatting will be
corrupted when viewing the help.  Please note that if your help is short, it is
worthwhile to pad with empty lines, up to 23 lines.

Please send any and all help files you wish to contribute, or any ideas for
help, to arch@archlinux.org with "[isohelp]" in the title.
