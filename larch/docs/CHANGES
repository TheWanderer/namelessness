2008.10.10
Version 5.3.9
larch-setup now creates relative (instead of absolute) symlinks.
Workaround in inpacs for absence of /dev/null at beginning of installation
(Arch bug). 
larch-live package updated to version 5.3.4 for initscripts-2008.09-2
and moved loading of loop module to larch1 hook, because of timing problems.

2008.08.10
Version 5.3.8
Added pacman-packed.tar.gz to repository, a self-contained pacman package,
including the libraries it needs to run. So now building on non-Arch
systems shuold work again.
Adjusted larch-setup to handle this new package.
'mirrorlist' now has '@carch@', which getPackageServer must handle (done
in PKGBUILD)

2008.08.09
Version 5.3.7
The packages.txt file is no longer supplied in Arch repositories, so inpacs
now gets the list of base packages using (something like) 'pacman -Sg base'.
As of pacman-3.2 there is no longer a static build, so building larch systems
on non-Arch boxes will no longer work:(
Tweaked xmaxi profile.

2008.07.30
Version 5.3.6
Remove unmaintained kde profile, replace mc-utf8 by mc in addedpacks

2008.06.22
Version 5.3.5
Fix mklarch for building on non-Arch system:
 - need to create package cache, otherwise inpacs complains.
 - tweak pacman.conf configuration concerning 'Include =' lines.
 - usb2bootiso needs bash (#!/bin/bash, not #!/bin/sh)
 - xpack (and existing .xpk files) fix (bash, not sh, and -n option to tail)
Try to overcome problems with usb-stick creation when hal remounts device
after formatting, by adding umount command.

2008.06.07
Version 5.3.4
Removed warnings about kconfig (as this is no longer included in Arch kernels.
Added check for mkisofs on host at beginning of buildlive (if building iso).
Added check for syslinux on target at beginning of buildlive (if not using
GRUB).
Minor profile tweaks.

2008.05.15
Version 5.3.2, adjusted initscripts approach so that it doesn't require a
custom initscripts package. Now rc.sysinit and rc.shutdown are replaced (in
buildlive) by larch versions which are compatible with the standard versions.
When larch-live is installed, the standard functions will be replaced by
larch functions. On installation using larchin larch-live will be removed
so the behaviour reverts to standard Arch behaviour, although the rc scripts
have been changed. But in any case the originals are saved so that they can
be restored on installation with larchin.

Changed handling of pacman.conf slightly. When there is a pacman.conf in the
profile (base directory, not overlay), this will be copied to the working
directory and used by mklarch, even if there was already a version in the
working directory. The pacman.conf in the live system will be this version
if built using mklarch, otherwise the existing version. However an
'IgnorePkg' line is added for kernel26, aufs and initscripts. Packages
listed in the 'noupdate' file in the profile, will also be added. This
line will be removed on installation using larchin.

2008.04.27
Version 5.3.0, new initscripts approach, replacing functions in
/etc/rc.d/functions rather than replacing /etc/rc.sysinit and
/etc/rc.shutdown. At present this requires a custom initscripts package.

2008.04.21
Version 5.2.2, added usb2iso, a fairly primitive script to make an iso from
a larch usb-stick. It also works from a running larch system, but only on
systems with a lot of memory.

2008.04.05
version 5.2.1, slight reworking of overlay handling in profiles - now files
owned by root:root do not have to be in overlay.xpk, they can be held within
directory 'rootoverlay', and their ownership will be changed automatically.
Files to be copied to /.livesys at boot are now in larch/copy.
Added larchquit.py to larch-live - special larch quit/logout gui, allows
selecting session-save options and also autologin user before quitting desktop,
included it in xmini menu/panel.
Other tweaks to xmini profile.

2008.02.27
Incompatible changes. WARNING!
With version 5.2 the init system has changed, in particular a custom inittab
is now required, which means all old profiles are likely to fail (because of
the /etc/inittab in the overlay).

2008.02.19
added desktop stuff for documentation

2008.02.18
version 5.1.3, bugfixes and work on profiles
