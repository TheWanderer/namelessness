I got my initial inspiration from the "Linux Live scripts" by

Tomas M. <http://www.linux-live.org>

BUT the larch scripts now bear essentially no resemblance to those,
so don't blame Tomas!
Thanks are, nevertheless, due to him for his great work, which helped me
get started.

The main documentation is in the share/docs subdirectory, please read it.

The key components are:

    inpacs  - Install a fresh Arch system (with customizable package
           selection), to a convenient (possibly temporary) location.

    mklarch - Uses 'inpacs' to build an Arch installation in a convenient
           directory, which it then makes into a live CD, adding
           modifications (in an overlay) to suit it for use as a live
           system and for customization.

    larchify - Build a larch live system from an existing Arch Linux
           installation (including from one made by 'mklarch').

The larch project uses Arch Linux as its basis, but is not an official
