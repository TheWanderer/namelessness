larch-5 (with simplified union structure, no CD/DVD session save,
         extended USB-stick session save)

Changes from larch-4:

Split functionality of 'mklarch', so that rebuilds after a 'mklarch' run,
and other builds from existing Arch installations, are now handled by the
'larchify' script - 'larchify -h' for usage notes. 'mklarch' now only covers
initial builds including installation - 'mklarch -h' for usage notes. Note
that the options have changed!!! For instance, 'mklarch -p' now expects a
directory as argument and there is no option to copy an example profile to
the current directory.

'pacin' replaced by 'inpacs' - 'inpacs -h' for usage notes. It is now
possible to fully customize pacman caches, and even pacman databases,
including the use of locally networked computers as source (using sshfs or
NFS). Thus a larch build can be made without an internet connection, if
all the packages are available locally on a suitably configured Arch
system.

Completely new union/overlay structure. The overlay is now copied to the
writable union layer at boot, and can be copied back at shutdown. This
should speed up session-saving, especially through the use of lzo
compression rather than squashfs. An additional advantage is that no extra
memory is required for the reconstruction of the archive.

When the overlay gets too large it can be merged into the secondary overlay,
a squashfs archive (like in previous larch versions). This takes somewhat
longer and requires memory for its construction, but subsequent simple
session saves (to the primary layer) will be faster because of the reduced
size.

It should now also be possible to run 'larchify' on a running live system,
allowing a complete reconstruction of the system from within itself,
merging in updates - in principle even kernel updates should be manageable
using this method.
