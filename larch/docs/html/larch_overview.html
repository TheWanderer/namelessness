<h2>Overview of the <em>larch</em> build system</h2>
<br />

<blockquote>
<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><em>Before we get started I should point out that most of the scripts need to
be run by the 'root' user. That is quite normal for an installer, but it is somewhat
risky - a slight slip and all sorts of damage could be done. Ideally you would
have a machine specially set aside for this sort of thing, i.e. one without any
important data on it. <strong>You have been warned!</strong></em>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="larch_installation"></a>Installation of the <em>larch</em> build system</h3>

<p>The <em>larch</em> package may be installed in the normal <em>Arch Linux</em> way using
<em>pacman</em>. This method will only work on an <em>Arch</em> system, of course.
</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>larch</em> may be used without installing it.
This should also work on non-<em>Arch Linux</em> systems. Download
<a href="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/larch/larch5.3/i686/larch-setup"><strong>larch-setup</strong></a>
to an empty working directory and run it (it is a shell script). This will in
turn download and unpack the current larch package, setting up symlinks so that
the build scripts can be run from this working directory.
If you don't put this new directory on your 'PATH', you may well
need to add a path prefix when running it (e.g. './mklarch' if your current
directory is the one containing the script).
</p>

<h3><a name="larch_using"></a>Using the <em>larch</em> build system</h3>

<p>For building a live medium from a 'profile' you need, primarily, <strong>mklarch</strong>;
for building from an existing installation (including rebuilding after using
<strong>mklarch</strong>) <strong>larchify</strong>. <strong>mklarch</strong>
uses <strong>inpacs</strong> to do the actual installation of the packages,
and the functions for performing the live CD creation are in the file
(larch/)<strong>buildlive</strong>.
</p>

<p>Unlike a normal installation, that used by larch need not be a separate partition,
it can be placed anywhere convenient.
The default installation directory ('/home/larchroot', variable 'INSTLDIR' in the scripts)
should normally be acceptable (the building work is done in the '.larch' sub-directory).
Note that lots of space is necessary in ${INSTLDIR}, nearly 4GB for a 700MB CD.
</p>

<h3><a name="running_mklarch"></a>Quick <strong>mklarch</strong> overview</h3>

<p>That first stage is very much like a normal <em>Arch</em> installation to a
partition - which is another possibility with the <strong>inpacs</strong> script.
A couple of small tweaks are made to this base installation to make it more
convenient for live CD/USB use: some glibc locales are generated (set by the file
locale.gen in the profile) and, if <em>openssh</em> is installed, the initial
ssh-keys are generated.
</p>

<p>Before <strong>mklarch</strong> can be used a 'profile' for the live medium must
be built. This is a folder containing configuration files determining which packages
are installed, which glibc locales are installed, and generally which files should
be customized. Further details are given in <a href="larch_profiles.html">'Profiles'</a>.
</p>

<p>A simple way to build an iso would then be:
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">./mklarch -p myprofile</pre>
</p>

<p>To build a live USB-stick using GRUB to boot and using the <em>pacman</em>
databases as they exist on the build host (rather than the default of
downloading the latest databases using 'pacman -Sy'):
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">./mklarch -p myprofile -y /var/lib/pacman -ug</pre>
</p>

<p>The build process can be stopped after the <em>Arch</em> system installation (before building
the 'squashed' live system) by passing the '-a' option to <strong>mklarch</strong>.
All the available options can be seen by running 'mklarch -h'.
</p>

<p>The rest of the build process is handled by the functions in
<strong>buildlive</strong>, primarily <em>mklive</em>,
which puts all the various components together into a CD image at
'${INSTLDIR}/.larch/cd', then using the <em>build_iso</em> function
to create the iso or (using the <strong>usbboot</strong> script) to prepare
a bootable USB-stick.
</p>

<p>If you set up your configuration
wrong (or if you or I made some other mistake ...), you might find
you have destroyed some important data and/or your system doesn't
work any more. But that's life - Share and Enjoy!
</p>

<h3><a name="running_larchify"></a>Quick <em>larchify</em> overview</h3>

<p><strong>larchify</strong> uses the functions in <strong>buildlive</strong> to
build a live medium from an existing <em>Arch Linux</em> installation. It can also be
used to rebuild a (posibly altered) live medium from the installation arising
from the use of <strong>mklarch</strong>. For example, after building an iso
using <strong>mklarch</strong>, you might want to build another with the same packages
but with a changed overlay - maybe an alteration to rc.conf. In that case you
could make the necessary changes to the profile and call:
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">./larchify -rp myprofile</pre>
The '-r' option causes the old squashed image to be used, which can save a lot
time. To see all the options run './larchify -h'.
</p>

<h3><a name="Minimal_build_system_requirements"></a>Minimal build system requirements</h3>

<p>The <em>larch</em> scripts have been designed to work without heavy
demands on the build system. Although they have been developed under <em>Arch Linux</em>,
they should run on other <em>GNU/Linux</em> systems. The required software has been
kept to a minimum by means of a sort of bootstrapping - some of the build
functions are carried out on the newly installed <em>Arch</em> system using <em>chroot</em>.
For example, you do not need support for <em>squashfs</em> or <em>aufs</em> on
the build system. <em>bash</em>, <em>mkisofs</em> and <em>wget</em>
are assumed to be available (for building a USB-stick version with syslinux you
also need <em>mkfs.vfat</em> from the 'dosfstools' package). If you are not
running <em>Arch Linux</em>, the installation script
(<strong>larch-setup</strong>) will set up pacman using a special package
available from the larch repository (pacman-packed.tar.gz), which contains
in addition to the pacman binary the run-time libraries it needs.
</p>

<h3><a name="pacman_conf"></a>'pacman.conf' for building and live system use</h3>

<p>You also need an appropriate 'pacman.conf' file. On a non-<em>Arch</em> system,
unless a pacman.conf is already present in the working directory, this will be
created afresh and a dialog will be presented by <strong>larch-setup</strong>
to select a mirror. Because of potential overwriting (see below) this file
is also copied to pacman.conf.0 (also in the working directory).
</p>
<p>On an <em>Arch</em> system it is assumed that you have already configured your
mirrors appropriately, and the system '/etc/pacman.conf' can be taken.
</p>
<p>When there is a 'pacman.conf' in the profile (base directory, not overlay),
this will be copied to the working directory and used by <em>mklarch</em>
for performing the installation, even if
there was already a version in the working directory. The 'pacman.conf' in
the resulting live system will also be this version if built using
<em>mklarch</em> (i.e. taken from the resulting file in the working
directory). If <em>larchify</em> is used the existing '/etc/pacman.conf'
within the system to be larchified will be used. However, if the overlay in
the profile has its own '/etc/pacman.conf' this will (in both cases) be
used in preference.
</p>
<p>Additionally, an 'IgnorePkg' line is added to the live system's '/etc/pacman.conf',
for 'kernel26', 'aufs' and 'initscripts'. Packages listed in the 'noupdate' file
in the profile, will also be added.
This line will be removed on installation using <em>larchin</em>.
</p>

<h3><a name="Squashfs_and_Unionfs"></a>squashfs and aufs</h3>

<p>The newly installed system is made into a <em>squashed</em> file-system in the
file <strong>system.sqf</strong>. This is mounted as the lower layer of a <em>union</em>
(<em>aufs</em>) file-system. On top of that there is a writable
<em>tmpfs</em> so that the file-system as a whole appears writable. An 'overlay'
archive is copied into the writable layer. As this top layer is compressed using
<em>lsop</em>, this package must be installed in the target.
Of course only the <em>tmpfs</em> top layer can actually be written to,
and its contents disappear when the system reboots, so the writing is only
temporary.
</p>

<p>There is also a second overlay archive, a squashed file system which forms
the middle layer of the union file-system, which increases the flexibillity of
the session saving facility.
</p>

<p>In order to boot into a system constructed in that manner, you need an
<em>initramfs</em> which deals with mounting all the various bits in the right
way before entering the normal boot sequence. In <em>larch</em> the
<em>initramfs</em> is built using the standard <em>Arch</em> 'mkinitcpio' system, for
which special 'hooks' (essentially code plug-ins) have been developed to
manage the requirements of a <em>larch</em> live system.
</p>

<h4><a name="aufs"></a>aufs as an alternative to unionfs</h4>
<p><em>larch</em> was initially designed around <em>unionfs</em>, but since then
<em>aufs</em> has been generally a more reliable alternative, and is now
available as a package in <em>Arch Linux</em>. In order to use <em>aufs</em> its
kernel module needs to be installed (which, if using <em>mklarch</em>, can be
achieved by placing package 'aufs' in <strong>addedpacks</strong>), the rest
will then be handled automatically. <strong>N.B.</strong> As <em>unionfs</em>
hasn't been tested for a long time (all development work is done using
<em>aufs</em>) and the current 'overlay merge' only works with <em>aufs</em>,
it is strongly recommended that <em>aufs</em> be used.
</p>

<h3><a name="Partial_rebuilding"></a>Partial rebuilding</h3>

<p>If you make some changes to a build which don't require a renewed
installation (the <em>Arch</em> installation in '${INSTLDIR}'), you can use the
<strong>larchify</strong> script to rebuild the system. Such changes might
be tweaks to the overlay, or 'rcconfx', for example (but note that the glibc
locales are in the installation so if you want to change these, you have to rerun the
whole installation, or handle that manually). If - as is likely - the squashed system
from the previous build is still there and is still valid,
this can be reused by passing the '-r' option (thus saving the time required to
squash the system).
</p>

<p> If you only make changes to files in '${INSTLDIR}/.larch/cd', you can rebuild
the iso using the '-i' option to <strong>larchify</strong>. But be aware that
some of the files in the directories 'isolinux' (when using the
<em>isolinux</em> bootloader) and 'boot' (when using the <em>GRUB</em> bootloader)
are renewed from 'larch/cd-root' and the 'cd-root' directory in the profile.
</p>

<p><em><strong>N.B.</strong> Even though the <em>Arch</em> installation is
in principle now redundant, you shouldn't delete it if you want to do a quick
rebuild using <strong>larchify</strong>, because this installation is used (via 'chroot')
for some of the build functions.</em>
</p>

<h3><a name="Custom_packages"></a>Custom packages</h3>

<p>It is possible to include your own 'custom' packages in the installation.
Maybe ones you have compiled yourself, e.g. from the AUR, or modified versions
(fixes or customizations) of standard packages. To do this you need to put your
packages in a directory and run <strong>gen-repo</strong> - which requires python -
on this directory (run it without arguments to get usage instructions). Then place
an entry for this new repository in your 'pacman.conf' (in the profile or else
in the working directory).
If your packages replace some in the existing repositories, your custom
repository needs to come before those repositories in 'pacman.conf'.
Any packages you want installed now just need to be
listed in <strong>addedpacks</strong>.
</p>

<p>It is not necessary to build a custom kernel for <em>larch</em>, the
standard kernel ('kernel26') can be used. It includes <em>unionfs</em>
and <em>squashfs</em> modules, and is now included in the set of 'base'
packages. If <em>aufs</em> is desired (which is likely, as at the time of writing,
<em>unionfs</em> didn't work very well), this must be included in
<strong>addedpacks</strong>.
</p>

<h3><a name="Generating_the_basepacks_list"></a>Generating
the <em>basepacks</em> list</h3>

<p>In case the base package set changes, <strong>inpacs</strong> uses the list
provided by 'pacman -Sg base' by default. However, if there is a 'basepacks'
file in the profile this will be used to supply the list of base packages
(one package per line).
</p>

<p><strong>inpacs</strong> can also be used separately for <em>Arch</em> installation.
To get a full listing of possible options run it without arguments (note that
it pays no attention to profiles, all options must be passed explicitly).
</p>

<p>It is possible to filter out certain unwanted packages from the base set.
In most cases the default setting will be satisfactory, but you can change it by
placing a 'baseveto' file (one package per line) in the profile directory.
Be aware, however, that vetoed packages will be installed anyway if they are
required by some other installed package.
</p>

<h3><a name="addedpacks"></a><em>addedpacks</em></h3>

<p>This group of packages is the main place for defining your system.
Here you can enter all the applications you would like in your live CD/USB system
(and subsequently installed to a hard disk partition, if that was your intention).
Thanks to <i>pacman</i> you don't need to sort out dependencies,
these should all be included automatically. It is (still) possible to
squeeze (or rather 'squash') quite a respectable quantity of software
onto a CD - my first experiments included most of <i>KDE</i>,
<i>OpenOffice</i>, <i>K3b</i>, <i>GIMP</i>, and quite a lot
besides.</p>

<h3><a name="Installation"></a>Installation of the initial system</h3>

<p>The foundation of the <em>larch</em> live CD/USB system is an initial,
potentially unconfigured <em>Arch Linux</em> system <em>squashed</em> up in the file
'system.sqf'. The installation of this system is can be handled by <em>mklarch</em>,
which uses <em>inpacs</em>, which in turn uses <em>pacman</em> to
install all the constituent packages using
the '-r' option to install to the chosen location, which can be anywhere where
there is enough space.</p>

<p>By default the package cache on the build host will be used, so that only
packages which have not already been downloaded will be fetched from the
chosen mirror. The '-c' option to <strong>mklarch</strong> allows another
cache location to be used. Note that this can also be on a remote machine,
mounted using <em>sshfs</em> or <em>NFS</em>.
</p>

<h3><a name="existingSystem"></a>Making a live CD from an existing <em>Arch</em>
installation</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, <strong>larchify</strong> can be used to make a live
medium from an existing <em>Arch</em> installation, using the mount point of the
installation as argument. The installation must already be mounted, including any
sub-mounts (e.g. /home on another partition). The main mount must be with
options 'exec,dev', because some of the building is done via a <em>chroot</em>
to the installation.
</p>

<p>It can also 'livify' the currently running (<em>Arch</em> only!) system, by
passing '/' as argument.
</p>

<p>All aspects of the larch building process connected with the installation
are in this case irrelevant, as it is assumed that the installation is already complete.
The handling of 'profiles' is also different as these are largely
concerned with the installation process. A profile may still be used, though,
maybe to customize the 'mkinitcpio.conf' used to build the live system's
<em>initramfs</em>, or to add extra content by means of the <strong>cd-root</strong>
folder, for example.
</p>

<p>In order to support building a <em>larch</em> system, certain packages outside
the <em>Arch</em> base group must be installed in the system to be 'larchified':
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>squashfs-tools</em>, <em>lzop</em>, <em>larch-live</em>,
<em>aufs</em> (if - recommended - you want to use that instead of <em>unionfs</em>),
<em>syslinux</em> (if using isolinux or syslinux),
<em>cdrkit</em> (for building an iso),
<em>eject</em> (to eject a CD at shutdown).

for the hard-disk installer - <em>larchin</em>, <em>python</em>, <em>pygtk</em>,
<em>parted</em>, <em>ntfsprogs</em>,
(optional, but recommended) <em>gparted</em>.

for this documentation, and for the capability of doing complete
rebuilds - <em>larch</em>
</pre>
</p>

<p>Note that some things in '/var' will not be included in the 'live' system.
Firstly, the standard <em>pacman</em> package cache, '/var/cache/pacman/pkg'.
Also the log files (in '/var/log') and '/var/tmp' (temporary files, like '/tmp')
are not saved. As some files in '/var/log' are required for certain aspects of
logging to function, these are recreated (as empty files) in the resulting
'system.sqf'.
